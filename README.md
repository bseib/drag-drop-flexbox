# drag-drop-flexbox
Demo of Drag and Drop used with Flexbox ordering

As drag events are fired, this Vue app dynamically updates a list of integers, which is used to assign a `style="order: n"` attribute to set the flexbox item order, making the list reorder dynamically as items are dragged.

See complete [demo](https://bseib.github.io/drag-drop-flexbox/dragdropflex-5.html).

These examples were used for a short talk I gave at [Hack Lafayette](https://www.meetup.com/hacklafayette/) in Aug 2018.
